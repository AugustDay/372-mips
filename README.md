1. Write a small MIPS assembly program to load two integer numbers from memory. Add them up. Then store the result back to memory. Save the source code to a file;

2. Manually translate the above MIPS assembly code to MIPS machine code (32 bits);

3. Write a C program to load the above assembly source code and translate it to machine code, load the machine code to memory, then execute the machine code. The C program should model the datapath of a MIPS computer, i.e., it should have an ALU, a register file, I-Mem, D-Mem, pipeline registers, and a PC. Take screenshots of the memory map to show that your program worked.
