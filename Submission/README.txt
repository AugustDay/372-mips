How to use our progra: after launching, a menu with register and memory values should display. Typing '1' will allow you to load a hex file for use in the program. input.hex is provided for this purpose.
Use '4' (Step), to go step by step through the execution. You should see the values in memory address 11 and 12 get loaded into registers 10 and 11, then added together into register 9. Then, this value is stored back into memory address 13. At this point, the program will Halt and terminate.
